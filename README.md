## Scenario

  You have been asked by the committee to follow the marketing team's design proposal to modify an existing the FECT web page. This page shows a list of digital collections. Each collection object we will call a __figure__. For a number of reasons you are asked not to modify index.html's structure or the order in which each figure is found in the html. You are allowed to add as much stuff as needed. A committee has chosen to change this page from a list view to a new grid layout. The new design should be responsive to width. When the mouse hovers over a figure the title should show and hide when mouse is no longer hovering over the figure. The drop down menu will allow you to filter the DOM to only show the desired group of figures for that group.


### How to start
You will need to have a Github account to complete this.
*   Fork this repo to your profile (USERNAME/FECT)
*   Make the necessary modifications to best resemble the expected outcome from the provided files.
*   All changes are expected to be pushed you your Github repo so we can review prior to the interview.
*   Following the design instructions as close as possible
    *    Change the list view of Figure Image + Figure Title to a grid of figures with titles hidden until a hover event on each figure.
    *    Code the drop down menu to hide everything except the requested figure group.
*   Follow the **WAI-ARIA 1.0** Standards as much as possible
    *   The tab index should go from left to right then down to the next row.
*   Follow the wireframe provided by the marketing department
